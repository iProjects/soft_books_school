                        <li class="one">Soft Books School is a school management software that has been designed
                            to address key and critical aspects of information processing, retrieval and storage
                            that define the core business of the school as an organization in a systematic,
                            timely and coordinated manner. </li>
                        <li class="two">The software is preferably configured on server to be accessed by various
                            authorized users from their respective workstations.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li class="three">It is particularly important for institutions which have invested
                            in computers, that the software would provide value-addition to their investment
                            and maximize the use and application of computers as office productivity tools.
                            Soft Books School has been developed in order to ease day to day activities.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li class="four">It also provides greater visibility of all the functions, such as grading
                            and attendance, and evaluation of reports at any point of the school year.<br />
                        </li>
                        <li class="five">At present, attendance, grading, lesson planning and other key activities
                            are very tedious and time consuming and need to be done repetitively.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li class="six">Moreover, Soft Books School will prevent all overheads, repetitive work,
                            and provide you more time to focus on teaching or constructive activities. This
                            also helps to ensure that you have all the tools needed to effectively build a solid
                            overall growth path for your students while also focusing on your own career.
